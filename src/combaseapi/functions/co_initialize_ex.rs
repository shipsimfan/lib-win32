    /// Initializes the COM library for use by the calling thread, sets the thread's concurrency

    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///  * `reserved` - This parameter is reserved and must be [`null_mut`].
    ///  * `co_init` - The concurrency model and initialization options for the thread. Values for
    ///                this parameter are taken from the `COINIT` constants. Any combination of
    ///                values from `COINIT` can be used, except that the
    ///                [`COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED`] and [`COINIT_MULTITHREADED`] flags cannot both
    ///                be set. The default is [`COINIT_MULTITHREADED`].
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    /// This function can return the standard return values [`E_INVALIDARG`], [`E_OUTOFMEMORY`],
    /// and [`E_UNEXPECTED`], as well as the following values:
    ///  * [`S_OK`] - The COM library was initialized successfully on this thread.
    ///  * [`S_FALSE`] - The COM library is already initialized on this thread.
    ///  * [`RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE`] - A previous call to [`CoInitializeEx`] specified an incompatible
    ///                             concurrency model for this thread. This could also indicate
    ///                             that a change from neutral-threaded apartment to
    ///                             single-threaded apartment has occurred.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// [`CoInitializeEx`] must be called at least once, and is usually called only once, for each
    /// thread that uses the COM library. Multiple calls to [`CoInitializeEx`] by the same thread
    /// are allowed as long as they pass the same concurrency flag, but subsequent valid calls
    /// return [`S_FALSE`]. If the concurrency flag does not match, then the call fails and returns
    /// [`RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE`]. (For the purpose of this rule, a call to [`CoInitialize`] is
    /// equivalent to calling [`CoInitializeEx`] with the [`COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED`] flag.) To
    /// uninitialize the COM library gracefully on a thread, each successful call to
    /// [`CoInitialize`] or [`CoInitializeEx`], including any call that returns [`S_FALSE`], must
    /// be balanced by a corresponding call to [`CoUninitialize`]. Once COM has been uninitialized
    /// on a thread, you can reinitialize it in any mode, subject to the constraints above.
    ///
    /// You need to initialize the COM library on a thread before you call any of the library
    /// functions except [`CoGetMalloc`], to get a pointer to the standard allocator, and the
    /// memory allocation functions. Otherwise, the COM function will return
    /// [`CO_E_NOTINITIALIZED`].
    ///
    /// Objects created in a single-threaded apartment (STA) receive method calls only from their
    /// apartment's thread, so calls are serialized and arrive only at message-queue boundaries
    /// (when the [`PeekMessage`] or [`SendMessage`] function is called).
    ///
    /// Objects created on a COM thread in a multithread apartment (MTA) must be able to receive
    /// method calls from other threads at any time. You would typically implement some form of
    /// concurrency control in a multithreaded object's code using synchronization primitives such
    /// as critical sections, semaphores, or mutexes to help protect the object's data.
    ///
    /// When an object that is configured to run in the neutral threaded apartment (NTA) is called
    /// by a thread that is in either an STA or the MTA, that thread transfers to the NTA. If this
    /// thread subsequently calls [`CoInitializeEx`], the call fails and returns
    /// [`RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE`].
    ///
    /// Because OLE technologies are not thread-safe, the [`OleInitialize`] function calls
    /// [`CoInitializeEx`] with the [`COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED`] flag. As a result, an apartment
    /// that is initialized for multithreaded object concurrency cannot use the features enabled by
    /// [`OleInitialize`].
    ///
    /// Because there is no way to control the order in which in-process servers are loaded or
    /// unloaded, do not call [`CoInitialize`], [`CoInitializeEx`], or [`CoUninitialize`] from the
    /// `DllMain` function.
