        /// Starting in Windows 8.1, apps that render with Direct2D and/or Direct3D (including
        /// CoreWindow and XAML interop) must call [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`] in response to the PLM
        /// suspend callback. The Direct3D runtime and the graphics driver will discard internal
        /// memory buffers allocated for the app, reducing its memory footprint.
        ///
        /// Calling this method does not change the rendering state of the graphics device and it
        /// has no effect on rendering operations. There is a brief performance hit when internal
        /// buffers are reallocated during the first rendering operations after the
        /// [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`] call, therefore apps should only call [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`]
        /// when going idle for a period of time (in response to PLM suspend, for example).
        ///
        /// Apps should ensure that they call [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`] as one of the last D3D
        /// operations done before going idle. Direct3D will normally defer the destruction of D3D
        /// objects. Calling [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`], however, forces Direct3D to destroy objects
        /// immediately. For this reason, it is not guaranteed that releasing the final reference
        /// on Direct3D objects after calling [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`] will cause the object to be
        /// destroyed and memory to be deallocated before the app suspends.
        ///
        /// Similar to [`ID3D11DeviceContext::flush`], apps should call
        /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::clear_state`] before calling [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`].
        /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::clear_state`] clears the Direct3D pipeline bindings, ensuring
        /// that Direct3D does not hold any references to the Direct3D objects you are trying to
        /// release.
        ///
        /// It is also prudent to release references on middleware before calling
        /// [`IDXGIDevice3::trim`], as that middleware may also need to release references to
