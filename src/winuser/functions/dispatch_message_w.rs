    /// The return value specifies the value returned by the window procedure. Although its meaning

    /// The [`MSG`] structure must contain valid message values. If the `msg` parameter points to a
    /// [`WM_TIMER`] message and the `l_param` parameter of the [`WM_TIMER`] message is not
    /// [`null_mut`], `l_param` points to a function that is called instead of the window
    /// procedure.
    ///
    /// Note that the application is responsible for retrieving and dispatching input messages to
    /// the dialog box. Most applications use the main message loop for this. However, to permit
    /// the user to move to and to select controls by using the keyboard, the application must call
    /// [`IsDialogMessage`].
