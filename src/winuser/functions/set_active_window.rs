    /// background. The window will be brought into the foreground (top of Z-Order) if its
    /// application is in the foreground when the system activates the window.
    ///
    /// If the window identified by the `wnd` parameter was created by the calling thread, the
    /// active window status of the calling thread is set to `wnd`. Otherwise, the active window
    /// status of the calling thread is set to [`null_mut`].
