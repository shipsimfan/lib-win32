/// Application-defined callback function used with the [`CreateDialog`] and [`DialogBox`] families
/// of functions. It processes messages sent to a modal or modeless dialog box. The [`DLGPROC`]
/// type defines a pointer to this callback function. `DialogProc` is a placeholder for the
/// application-defined function name.
///
/// # Parameters
///  * `unnamed_param1` - A handle to the dialog box.
///  * `unnamed_param2` - The message.
///  * `unnamed_param3` - Additional message-specific information.
///  * `unnamed_param4` - Additional message-specific information.
///
/// # Return Value
/// Typically, the dialog box procedure should return [`TRUE`] if it processed the message, and
/// [`FALSE`] if it did not. If the dialog box procedure returns [`FALSE`], the dialog manager
/// performs the default dialog operation in response to the message.
///
/// If the dialog box procedure processes a message that requires a specific return value, the
/// dialog box procedure should set the desired return value by calling
/// `SetWindowLong(hwndDlg, DWL_MSGRESULT, lResult)` immediately before returning [`TRUE`]. Note
/// that you must call [`SetWindowLong`] immediately before returning TRUE; doing so earlier may
/// result in the [`DWL_MSGRESULT`] value being overwritten by a nested dialog box message.
///
/// The following messages are exceptions to the general rules stated above. Consult the
/// documentation for the specific message for details on the semantics of the return value.
///  - [`WM_CHARTOITEM`]
///  - [`WM_COMPAREITEM`]
///  - [`WM_CTLCOLORBTN`]
///  - [`WM_CTLCOLORDLG`]
///  - [`WM_CTLCOLOREDIT`]
///  - [`WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX`]
///  - [`WM_CTLCOLORSCROLLBAR`]
///  - [`WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC`]
///  - [`WM_INITDIALOG`]
///  - [`WM_QUERYDRAGICON`]
///  - [`WM_VKEYTOITEM`]
///
/// # Remarks
/// You should use the dialog box procedure only if you use the dialog box class for the dialog
/// box. This is the default class and is used when no explicit class is specified in the dialog
/// box template. Although the dialog box procedure is similar to a window procedure, it must not
/// call the [`DefWindowProc`] function to process unwanted messages. Unwanted messages are
/// processed internally by the dialog box window procedure.
