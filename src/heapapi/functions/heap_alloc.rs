    /// # Parameters
    ///  * `heap` - A handle to the heap from which the memory will be allocated. This handle is
    ///             returned by the [`HeapCreate`] or [`GetProcessHeap`] function.
    ///  * `flags` - The heap allocation options. Specifying any of these values will override the
    ///              corresponding value specified when the heap was created with [`HeapCreate`].
    ///              This parameter can be one or more of the following values:
    ///    * [`HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS`] - The system will raise an exception to indicate a
    ///                                     function failure, such as an out-of-memory condition,
    ///                                     instead of returning [`null_mut`]. To ensure that
    ///                                     exceptions are generated for all calls to this
    ///                                     function, specify [`HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS`] in the
    ///                                     call to [`HeapCreate`]. In this case, it is not
    ///                                     necessary to additionally specify
    ///                                     [`HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS`] in this function call.
    ///    * [`HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE`] - Serialized access will not be used for this allocation. To
    ///                              ensure that serialized access is disabled for all calls to
    ///                              this function, specify [`HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE`] in the call to
    ///                              [`HeapCreate`]. In this case, it is not necessary to
    ///                              additionally specify [`HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE`] in this function
    ///                              call. This value should not be specified when accessing the
    ///                              process's default heap. The system may create additional
    ///                              threads within the application's process, such as a `CTRL+C`
    ///                              handler, that simultaneously access the process's default
    ///                              heap.
    ///    * [`HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY`] - The allocated memory will be initialized to zero. Otherwise,
    ///                             the memory is not initialized to zero.
    ///  * `bytes` - The number of bytes to be allocated. If the heap specified by the `heap`
    ///              parameter is a "non-growable" heap, `bytes` must be less than `0x7FFF8`. You
    ///              create a non-growable heap by calling the HeapCreate function with a nonzero
    ///              value.
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    /// If the function succeeds, the return value is a pointer to the allocated memory block.
    ///
    /// If the function fails and you have not specified [`HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS`], the return
    /// value is [`null_mut`].
    ///
    /// If the function fails and you have specified [`HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS`], the function may
    /// generate either of the exceptions listed in below. The particular exception depends upon
    /// the nature of the heap corruption.
    ///  * `STATUS_NO_MEMORY` - The allocation attempt failed because of a lack of available memory
    ///                         or heap corruption.
    ///  * `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` - The allocation attempt failed because of heap corruption or
    ///                                improper function parameters.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// If the [`HeapAlloc`] function succeeds, it allocates at least the amount of memory
    /// requested.
    ///
    /// To allocate memory from the process's default heap, use [`HeapAlloc`] with the handle
    /// returned by the [`GetProcessHeap`] function.
    ///
    /// To free a block of memory allocated by [`HeapAlloc`], use the [`HeapFree`] function.
    ///
    /// Memory allocated by [`HeapAlloc`] is not movable. The address returned by [`HeapAlloc`] is
    /// valid until the memory block is freed or reallocated; the memory block does not need to be
    /// locked. Because the system cannot compact a private heap, it can become fragmented.
    ///
    /// The alignment of memory returned by [`HeapAlloc`] is [`MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT`].
    ///
    /// Applications that allocate large amounts of memory in various allocation sizes can use the
    /// low-fragmentation heap to reduce heap fragmentation.
    ///
    /// Serialization ensures mutual exclusion when two or more threads attempt to simultaneously
    /// allocate or free blocks from the same heap. There is a small performance cost to
    /// serialization, but it must be used whenever multiple threads allocate and free memory from
    /// the same heap. Setting the [`HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE`] value eliminates mutual exclusion on the
    /// heap. Without serialization, two or more threads that use the same heap handle might
    /// attempt to allocate or free memory simultaneously, likely causing corruption in the heap.
    /// The [`HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE`] value can, therefore, be safely used only in the following
    /// situations:
    ///  - The process has only one thread.
    ///  - The process has multiple threads, but only one thread calls the heap functions for a
    ///    specific heap.
    ///  - The process has multiple threads, and the application provides its own mechanism for
    ///    mutual exclusion to a specific heap.
