        /// [`D3D11_BIND_FLAG::ConstantBuffer`]), you must set the `byte_width` value of

        /// [`D3D11_REQ_CONSTANT_BUFFER_ELEMENT_COUNT`].

        /// The Direct3D 11.1 runtime, which is available on Windows 8 and later operating
        /// systems, provides the following new functionality for [`ID3D11Device::create_buffer`]:
        ///
        /// You can create a constant buffer that is larger than the maximum constant buffer size
        /// that a shader can access (4096 32-bit*4-component constants â€“ 64KB). When you bind the
        /// constant buffer to the pipeline (for example, via
        /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::ps_set_constant_buffers`] or
        /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::ps_set_constant_buffers1`]), you can define a range of the
        /// buffer that the shader can access that fits within the 4096 constant limit.
        ///
        /// The Direct3D 11.1 runtime (available in Windows 8 and later operating systems) emulates
        /// this feature for feature level 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3; therefore, this feature is supported
