    /// A counter can be created with [`ID3D11Device::create_counter`].
    ///
    /// This is a derived class of [`ID3D11Asynchronous`].
    ///
    /// Counter data is gathered by issuing an [`ID3D11DeviceContext::begin`] command, issuing some
    /// graphics commands, issuing an [`ID3D11DeviceContext::end`] command, and then calling
    /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::get_data`] to get data about what happened in between the
    /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::begin`] and [`ID3D11DeviceContext::end`] calls. The data returned by
    /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::get_data`] will be different depending on the type of counter. The
    /// call to [`ID3D11DeviceContext::end`] causes the data returned by
    /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::get_data`] to be accurate up until the last call to
    /// [`ID3D11DeviceContext::end`].
    ///
    /// Counters are best suited for profiling.
    ///
    /// For a list of the types of performance counters, see [`D3D11_COUNTER`].
