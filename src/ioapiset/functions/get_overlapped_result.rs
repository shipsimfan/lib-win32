    /// # Parameters
    ///  * `file` - A handle to the file, named pipe, or communications device. This is the same
    ///             handle that was specified when the overlapped operation was started by a call
    ///             to any of the following functions:
    ///    - [`ReadFile`]
    ///    - [`WriteFile`]
    ///    - [`ConnectNamedPipe`]
    ///    - [`TransactNamedPipe`]
    ///    - [`DeviceIoControl`]
    ///    - [`WaitCommEvent`]
    ///    - [`ReadDirectoryChangesW`]
    ///    - [`LockFileEx`]
    ///  * `overlapped` - A pointer to an [`OVERLAPPED`] structure that was specified when the
    ///                   overlapped operation was started.
    ///  * `number_of_bytes_transferred` - A pointer to a variable that receives the number of
    ///                                    bytes that were actually transferred by a read or write
    ///                                    operation. For a [`TransactNamedPipe`] operation, this
    ///                                    is the number of bytes that were read from the pipe. For
    ///                                    a [`DeviceIoControl`] operation, this is the number of
    ///                                    bytes of output data returned by the device driver. For
    ///                                    a [`ConnectNamedPipe`] or [`WaitCommEvent`] operation,
    ///                                    this value is undefined.
    ///  * `wait` - If this parameter is [`TRUE`], and the `internal` member of the `overlapped`
    ///             structure is [`STATUS_PENDING`], the function does not return until the
    ///             operation has been completed. If this parameter is [`FALSE`] and the operation
    ///             is still pending, the function returns [`FALSE`] and the [`GetLastError`]
    ///             function returns [`ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE`].
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    /// If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.
    ///
    /// If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call
    /// [`GetLastError`].
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// The results reported by the [`GetOverlappedResult`] function are those of the specified
    /// handle's last overlapped operation to which the specified [`OVERLAPPED`] structure was
    /// provided, and for which the operation's results were pending. A pending operation is
    /// indicated when the function that started the operation returns [`FALSE`], and the
    /// [`GetLastError`] function returns [`ERROR_IO_PENDING`]. When an I/O operation is pending,
    /// the function that started the operation resets the hEvent member of the [`OVERLAPPED`]
    /// structure to the nonsignaled state. Then when the pending operation has been completed, the
    /// system sets the event object to the signaled state.
    ///
    /// If the `wait` parameter is [`TRUE`], [`GetOverlappedResult`] determines whether the pending
    /// operation has been completed by waiting for the event object to be in the signaled state.
    ///
    /// If the `event` member of the [`OVERLAPPED`] structure is [`null_mut`], the system uses the
    /// state of the `file` handle to signal when the operation has been completed. Use of file,
    /// named pipe, or communications-device handles for this purpose is discouraged. It is safer
    /// to use an event object because of the confusion that can occur when multiple simultaneous
    /// overlapped operations are performed on the same file, named pipe, or communications device.
    /// In this situation, there is no way to know which operation caused the object's state to be
    /// signaled.
