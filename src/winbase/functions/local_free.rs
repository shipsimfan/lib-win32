    /// # Parameters
    ///  * `mem` - A handle to the local memory object. This handle is returned by either the
    ///            [`LocalAlloc`] or [`LocalReAlloc`] function. It is not safe to free memory
    ///            allocated with [`GlobalAlloc`].
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    /// If the function succeeds, the return value is [`null_mut`].
    ///
    /// If the function fails, the return value is equal to a handle to the local memory object. To
    /// get extended error information, call [`GetLastError`].
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// If the process tries to examine or modify the memory after it has been freed, heap
    /// corruption may occur or an access violation exception may be generated.
    ///
    /// If the `mem` parameter is [`null_mut`], [`LocalFree`] ignores the parameter and returns
    /// [`null_mut`].
    ///
    /// The [`LocalFree`] function will free a locked memory object. A locked memory object has a
    /// lock count greater than zero. The [`LocalLock`] function locks a local memory object and
    /// increments the lock count by one. The [`LocalUnlock`] function unlocks it and decrements
    /// the lock count by one. To get the lock count of a local memory object, use the
    /// [`LocalFlags`] function.
    ///
    /// If an application is running under a debug version of the system, [`LocalFree`] will issue
    /// a message that tells you that a locked object is being freed. If you are debugging the
    /// application, [`LocalFree`] will enter a breakpoint just before freeing a locked object.
    /// This allows you to verify the intended behavior, then continue execution.
