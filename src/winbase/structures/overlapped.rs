/// The `offset` and `offset_high` members together represent a 64-bit file position. It is a byte
/// offset from the start of the file or file-like device, and it is specified by the user; the
/// system will not modify these values. The calling process must set this member before passing
/// the [`OVERLAPPED`] structure to functions that use an offset, such as the [`ReadFile`] or
/// [`WriteFile`] (and related) functions.
///
/// You can use the [`HasOverlappedIoCompleted`] macro to check whether an asynchronous I/O
/// operation has completed if [`GetOverlappedResult`] is too cumbersome for your application.
///
/// You can use the [`CancelIo`] function to cancel an asynchronous I/O operation.
///
/// A common mistake is to reuse an [`OVERLAPPED`] structure before the previous asynchronous
/// operation has been completed. You should use a separate structure for each request. You should
/// also create an event object for each thread that processes data. If you store the event handles
/// in an array, you could easily wait for all events to be signaled using the
/// [`WaitForMultipleObjects`] function.
