    /// # Parameters
    ///  * `milliseconds` - The time interval for which execution is to be suspended, in
    ///                     milliseconds. A value of zero causes the thread to relinquish the
    ///                     remainder of its time slice to any other thread that is ready to run.
    ///                     If there are no other threads ready to run, the function returns
    ///                     immediately, and the thread continues execution. Windows XP: A value of
    ///                     zero causes the thread to relinquish the remainder of its time slice to
    ///                     any other thread of equal priority that is ready to run. If there are
    ///                     no other threads of equal priority ready to run, the function returns
    ///                     immediately, and the thread continues execution. This behavior changed
    ///                     starting with Windows Server 2003. A value of [`INFINITE`] indicates
    ///                     that the suspension should not time out.
    ///  * `alertable` - If this parameter is [`FALSE`], the function does not return until the
    ///                  time-out period has elapsed. If an I/O completion callback occurs, the
    ///                  function does not immediately return and the I/O completion function is
    ///                  not executed. If an APC is queued to the thread, the function does not
    ///                  immediately return and the APC function is not executed. If the parameter
    ///                  is [`TRUE`] and the thread that called this function is the same thread
    ///                  that called the extended I/O function ([`ReadFileEx`] or [`WriteFileEx`]),
    ///                  the function returns when either the time-out period has elapsed or when
    ///                  an I/O completion callback function occurs. If an I/O completion callback
    ///                  occurs, the I/O completion function is called. If an APC is queued to the
    ///                  thread ([`QueueUserAPC`]), the function returns when either the time-out
    ///                  period has elapsed or when the APC function is called.
    ///
    /// # Return Value
    /// The return value is zero if the specified time interval expired.
    ///
    /// The return value is [`WAIT_IO_COMPLETION`] if the function returned due to one or more I/O
    /// completion callback functions. This can happen only if `alertable` is [`TRUE`], and if the
    /// thread that called the [`SleepEx`] function is the same thread that called the extended I/O
    /// function.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// This function causes a thread to relinquish the remainder of its time slice and become
    /// unrunnable for an interval based on the value of `milliseconds`. After the sleep interval
    /// has passed, the thread is ready to run. Note that a ready thread is not guaranteed to run
    /// immediately. Consequently, the thread will not run until some arbitrary time after the
    /// sleep interval elapses, based upon the system "tick" frequency and the load factor from
    /// other processes. The system clock "ticks" at a constant rate. To increase the accuracy of
    /// the sleep interval, call the [`timeGetDevCaps`] function to determine the supported minimum
    /// timer resolution and the [`timeBeginPeriod`] function to set the timer resolution to its
    /// minimum. Use caution when calling [`timeBeginPeriod`], as frequent calls can significantly
    /// affect the system clock, system power usage, and the scheduler. If you call
    /// [`timeBeginPeriod`], call it one time early in the application and be sure to call the
    /// [`timeEndPeriod`] function at the very end of the application. If you specify 0
    /// milliseconds, the thread will relinquish the remainder of its time slice but remain ready.
    ///
    /// This function can be used with the [`ReadFileEx`] or [`WriteFileEx`] functions to suspend a
    /// thread until an I/O operation has been completed. These functions specify a completion
    /// routine that is to be executed when the I/O operation has been completed. For the
    /// completion routine to be executed, the thread that called the I/O function must be in an
    /// alertable wait state when the completion callback function occurs. A thread goes into an
    /// alertable wait state by calling either [`SleepEx`], [`MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx`],
    /// [`WaitForSingleObjectEx`], or [`WaitForMultipleObjectsEx`], with the function's `alertable`
    /// parameter set to [`TRUE`].
    ///
    /// Be careful when using [`SleepEx`] in the following scenarios:
    ///  - Code that directly or indirectly creates windows (for example, DDE and COM
    ///    [`CoInitialize`]). If a thread creates any windows, it must process messages. Message
    ///    broadcasts are sent to all windows in the system. If you have a thread that uses
    ///    [`SleepEx`] with infinite delay, the system will deadlock.
    ///  - Threads that are under concurrency control. For example, an I/O completion port or
    ///    thread pool limits the number of associated threads that can run. If the maximum number
    ///    of threads is already running, no additional associated thread can run until a running
    ///    thread finishes. If a thread uses [`SleepEx`] with an interval of zero to wait for one
    ///    of the additional associated threads to accomplish some work, the process might
    ///    deadlock.
    ///
    /// For these scenarios, use [`MsgWaitForMultipleObjects`] or [`MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx`],
    /// rather than [`SleepEx`].
