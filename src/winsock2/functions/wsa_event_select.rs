    /// As in the case of the [`select`] and [`WSAAsyncSelect`] functions, [`WSAEventSelect`] will
    /// frequently be used to determine when a data transfer operation ([`send`] or [`recv`]) can
    /// be issued with the expectation of immediate success. Nevertheless, a robust application
    /// must be prepared for the possibility that the event object is set and it issues a Windows
    /// Sockets call that returns [`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`] immediately. For example, the following
    /// sequence of operations is possible:
    ///  - Data arrives on socket `s`; Windows Sockets sets the [`WSAEventSelect`] event object.
    ///  - The application does some other processing.
    ///  - While processing, the application issues an `ioctlsocket(s, FIONREAD...)` and notices
    ///    that there is data ready to be read.
    ///  - The application issues a `recv(s,...)` to read the data.
    ///  - The application eventually waits on the event object specified in [`WSAEventSelect`],
    ///    which returns immediately indicating that data is ready to read.
    ///  - The application issues `recv(s,...)`, which fails with the error [`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`].
    ///
    /// Having successfully recorded the occurrence of the network event (by setting the
    /// corresponding bit in the internal network event record) and signaled the associated event
    /// object, no further actions are taken for that network event until the application makes the
    /// function call that implicitly reenables the setting of that network event and signaling of
    /// the associated event object.
    ///
    ///  * [`FD_READ`] - The [`recv`], [`recvfrom`], [`WSARecv`], [`WSARecvEx`], or [`WSARecvFrom`]
    ///                  function.
    ///  * [`FD_WRITE`] - The [`send`], [`sendto`], [`WSASend`], or [`WSASendTo`] function.
    ///  * [`FD_OOB`] - The [`recv`], [`recvfrom`], [`WSARecv`], [`WSARecvEx`], or [`WSARecvFrom`]

    ///  * [`FD_ACCEPT`] - The [`accept`], [`AcceptEx`], or [`WSAAccept`] function unless the error
    ///                    code returned is [`WSATRY_AGAIN`] indicating that the condition function
    ///                    returned CF_DEFER.

    ///  * [`FD_GROUP_QOS`] - Reserved.
    ///  * [`FD_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE`] - The [`WSAIoctl`] function with command

    /// Any call to the reenabling routine, even one that fails, results in reenabling of recording
    /// and signaling for the relevant network event and event object.
    ///
    /// For [`FD_READ`], [`FD_OOB`], and [`FD_ACCEPT`] network events, network event recording and
    /// event object signaling are level-triggered. This means that if the reenabling routine is
    /// called and the relevant network condition is still valid after the call, the network event
    /// is recorded and the associated event object is set. This allows an application to be
    /// event-driven and not be concerned with the amount of data that arrives at any one time.
    /// Consider the following sequence:
    ///  1. The transport provider receives 100 bytes of data on socket `s` and causes WS2_32.DLL
    ///     to record the [`FD_READ`] network event and set the associated event object.
    ///  2. The application issues `recv(s, buffptr, 50, 0)` to read 50 bytes.
    ///  3. The transport provider causes WS2_32.DLL to record the [`FD_READ`] network event and
    ///     sets the associated event object again since there is still data to be read.
    ///
    /// With these semantics, an application need not read all available data in response to an
    /// [`FD_READ`] network eventâ€”a single `recv` in response to each [`FD_READ`] network event is
    /// appropriate.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_QOS`] event is considered edge triggered. A message will be posted exactly once
    /// when a quality of service change occurs. Further messages will not be forthcoming until
    /// either the provider detects a further change in quality of service or the application
    /// renegotiates the quality of service for the socket.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE`] and [`FD_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE`] events are considered
    /// edge triggered as well. A message will be posted exactly once when a change occurs after
    /// the application has requested the notification by issuing [`WSAIoctl`] with
    /// [`SIO_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE`] or [`SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE`] correspondingly. Other
    /// messages will not be forthcoming until the application reissues the `IOCTL` and another
    /// change is detected since the `IOCTL` has been issued.
    ///
    /// If a network event has already happened when the application calls [`WSAEventSelect`] or
    /// when the reenabling function is called, then a network event is recorded and the associated
    /// event object is set as appropriate. For example, consider the following sequence:
    ///  1. An application calls [`listen`].
    ///  2. A connect request is received but not yet accepted.
    ///  3. The application calls [`WSAEventSelect`] specifying that it is interested in the
    ///     [`FD_ACCEPT`] network event for the socket. Due to the persistence of network events,
    ///     Windows Sockets records the [`FD_ACCEPT`] network event and sets the associated event
    ///     object immediately.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_WRITE`] network event is handled slightly differently. An [`FD_WRITE`] network
    /// event is recorded when a socket is first connected with a call to the [`connect`],
    /// [`ConnectEx`], [`WSAConnect`], [`WSAConnectByList`], or [`WSAConnectByName`] function or
    /// when a socket is accepted with [`accept`], [`AcceptEx`], or [`WSAAccept`] function and then
    /// after a send fails with [`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`] and buffer space becomes available. Therefore,
    /// an application can assume that sends are possible starting from the first [`FD_WRITE`]
    /// network event setting and lasting until a send returns [`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`]. After such a
    /// failure the application will find out that sends are again possible when an [`FD_WRITE`]
    /// network event is recorded and the associated event object is set.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_OOB`] network event is used only when a socket is configured to receive OOB data
    /// separately. If the socket is configured to receive OOB data inline, the OOB (expedited)
    /// data is treated as normal data and the application should register an interest in, and will
    /// get [`FD_READ`] network event, not [`FD_OOB`] network event. An application can set or
    /// inspect the way in which OOB data is to be handled by using [`setsockopt`] or
    /// [`getsockopt`] for the [`SO_OOBINLINE`] option.
    ///
    /// The error code in an [`FD_CLOSE`] network event indicates whether the socket close was
    /// graceful or abortive. If the error code is zero, then the close was graceful; if the error
    /// code is [`WSAECONNRESET`], then the socket's virtual circuit was reset. This only applies
    /// to connection-oriented sockets such as [`SOCK_STREAM`].
    ///
    /// The [`FD_CLOSE`] network event is recorded when a close indication is received for the
    /// virtual circuit corresponding to the socket. In TCP terms, this means that the [`FD_CLOSE`]
    /// is recorded when the connection goes into the `TIME WAIT` or `CLOSE WAIT` states. This
    /// results from the remote end performing a [`shutdown`] on the send side or a
    /// [`closesocket`]. [`FD_CLOSE`] being posted after all data is read from a socket. An
    /// application should check for remaining data upon receipt of [`FD_CLOSE`] to avoid any
    /// possibility of losing data.
    ///
    /// Note that Windows Sockets will record only an [`FD_CLOSE`] network event to indicate
    /// closure of a virtual circuit. It will not record an [`FD_READ`] network event to indicate
    /// this condition.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_QOS`] or [`FD_GROUP_QOS`] network event is recorded when any parameter in the flow
    /// specification associated with socket `s`. Applications should use [`WSAIoctl`] with command
    /// [`SIO_GET_QOS`] to get the current quality of service for socket `s`.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE`] network event is recorded when the local interface that
    /// should be used to reach the destination specified in [`WSAIoctl`] with
    /// [`SIO_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE`] changes after such `IOCTL` has been issued.
    ///
    /// The [`FD_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE`] network event is recorded when the list of addresses of
    /// protocol family for the socket to which the application can bind changes after [`WSAIoctl`]
    /// with [`SIO_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE`] has been issued.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// The [`WSAEventSelect`] function is used to specify an event object, `event_object`, to be
    /// associated with the selected `FD_XXX` network events, `network_events`. The socket for
    /// which an event object is specified is identified by the `s` parameter. The event object is
    /// set when any of the nominated network events occur.
    ///
    /// The [`WSAEventSelect`] function operates very similarly to [`WSAAsyncSelect`], the
    /// difference being the actions taken when a nominated network event occurs. The
    /// [`WSAAsyncSelect`] function causes an application-specified Windows message to be posted.
    /// The [`WSAEventSelect`] sets the associated event object and records the occurrence of this
    /// event in an internal network event record. An application can use
    /// [`WSAWaitForMultipleEvents`] to wait or poll on the event object, and use
    /// [`WSAEnumNetworkEvents`] to retrieve the contents of the internal network event record and
    /// thus determine which of the nominated network events have occurred.
    ///
    /// The proper way to reset the state of an event object used with the [`WSAEventSelect`]
    /// function is to pass the handle of the event object to the [`WSAEnumNetworkEvents`] function
    /// in the `event_object` parameter. This will reset the event object and adjust the status of
    /// active FD events on the socket in an atomic fashion.
    ///
    /// [`WSAEventSelect`] is the only function that causes network activity and errors to be
    /// recorded and retrievable through [`WSAEnumNetworkEvents`]. See the descriptions of
    /// [`select`] and [`WSAAsyncSelect`] to find out how those functions report network activity
    /// and errors.
    ///
    /// The [`WSAEventSelect`] function automatically sets socket `s` to nonblocking mode,
    /// regardless of the value of `network_events`. To set socket `s` back to blocking mode, it is
    /// first necessary to clear the event record associated with socket `s` via a call to
    /// [`WSAEventSelect`] with `network_events` set to zero and the `event_object` parameter set
    /// to [`null_mut`]. You can then call [`ioctlsocket`] or [`WSAIoctl`] to set the socket back
    /// to blocking mode.
    ///
    /// The `network_events` parameter is constructed by using the bitwise OR operator with any of
    /// the values specified in the following list:
    ///  * [`FD_READ`] - Wants to receive notification of readiness for reading.
    ///  * [`FD_WRITE`] - Wants to receive notification of readiness for writing.
    ///  * [`FD_OOB`] - Wants to receive notification of the arrival of OOB data.
    ///  * [`FD_ACCEPT`] - Wants to receive notification of incoming connections.
    ///  * [`FD_CONNECT`] - Wants to receive notification of completed connection or multipoint
    ///                     join operation.
    ///  * [`FD_CLOSE`] - Wants to receive notification of socket closure.
    ///  * [`FD_QOS`] - Wants to receive notification of socket QoS changes.
    ///  * [`FD_GROUP_QOS`] - Reserved for future use with socket groups. Want to receive
    ///                       notification of socket group QoS changes.
    ///  * [`FD_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE`] - Wants to receive notification of routing interface
    ///                                      changes for the specified destination.
    ///  * [`FD_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE`] - Wants to receive notification of local address list changes
    ///                                 for the address family of the socket.
