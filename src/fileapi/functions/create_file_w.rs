    /// Creates or opens a file or I/O device. The most commonly used I/O devices are as follows:
    /// file, file stream, directory, physical disk, volume, console buffer, tape drive,
    /// communications resource, mailslot, and pipe. The function returns a handle that can be used
    /// to access the file or device for various types of I/O depending on the file or device and
    /// the flags and attributes specified.
    ///
    /// To perform this operation as a transacted operation, which results in a handle that can be
    /// used for transacted I/O, use the [`CreateFileTransacted`] function.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///  * `file_name` - The name of the file or device to be created or opened. You may use either
    ///                  forward slashes (/) or backslashes (\) in this name. To create a file
    ///                  stream, specify the name of the file, a colon, and then the name of the
    ///                  stream. By default, the name is limited to [`MAX_PATH`] characters. To
    ///                  extend this limit to 32,767 wide characters, prepend "\\?\" to the path.
    ///  * `desired_access` - The requested access to the file or device, which can be summarized
    ///                       as read, write, both or neither zero). The most commonly used values
    ///                       are [`GENERIC_READ`], [`GENERIC_WRITE`], or both
    ///                       `(GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE)`. If this parameter is zero, the
    ///                       application can query certain metadata such as file, directory, or
    ///                       device attributes without accessing that file or device, even if

    ///                       open handle.
    ///  * `share_mode` - The requested sharing mode of the file or device, which can be read,

    ///                   table). Access requests to attributes or extended attributes are not

    ///                              or device if it requests delete access. If this flag is not

    ///                              access, the function fails.
    ///    * [`FILE_SHARE_READ`] - Enables subsequent open operations on a file or device to
    ///                            request read access. Otherwise, no process can open the file or
    ///                            device if it requests read access. If this flag is not

    ///    * [`FILE_SHARE_WRITE`] - Enables subsequent open operations on a file or device to
    ///                             request write access. Otherwise, no process can open the file
    ///                             or device if it requests write access. If this flag is not

    ///                             access or has a file mapping with write access, the function
    ///                             fails.
    ///  * `security_attributes` - A pointer to a [`SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES`] structure that contains
    ///                            two separate but related data members: an optional security
    ///                            descriptor, and a Boolean value that determines whether the
    ///                            returned handle can be inherited by child processes. This
    ///                            parameter can be [`null_mut`]. If this parameter is
    ///                            [`null_mut`], the handle returned by [`CreateFile`] cannot be
    ///                            inherited by any child processes the application may create and
    ///                            the file or device associated with the returned handle gets a
    ///                            default security descriptor. The `security_descriptor` member of
    ///                            the structure specifies a [`SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR`] for a file or
    ///                            device. If this member is [`null_mut`], the file or device
    ///                            associated with the returned handle is assigned a default
    ///                            security descriptor. [`CreateFile`] ignores the
    ///                            `security_descriptor` member when opening an existing file or
    ///                            device, but continues to use the `inherit_handle` member. The
    ///                            `inherit_handle` member of the structure specifies whether the
    ///                            returned handle can be inherited.
    ///  * `creation_disposition` - An action to take on a file or device that exists or does not
    ///                             exist. For devices other than files, this parameter is usually
    ///                             set to [`OPEN_EXISTING`]. This parameter must be one of the
    ///                             following values, which cannot be combined:
    ///    * [`CREATE_ALWAYS`] - Creates a new file, always. If the specified file exists and is
    ///                          writable, the function truncates the file, the function succeeds,
    ///                          and last-error code is set to [`ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS`] (183). If
    ///                          the specified file does not exist and is a valid path, a new file
    ///                          is created, the function succeeds, and the last-error code is set
    ///                          to zero.
    ///    * [`CREATE_NEW`] - 	Creates a new file, only if it does not already exist. If the
    ///                         specified file exists, the function fails and the last-error code
    ///                         is set to [`ERROR_FILE_EXISTS`] (80). If the specified file does
    ///                         not exist and is a valid path to a writable location, a new file is
    ///                         created.
    ///    * [`OPEN_ALWAYS`] - Opens a file, always. If the specified file exists, the function
    ///                        succeeds and the last-error code is set to [`ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS`]
    ///                        (183). If the specified file does not exist and is a valid path to
    ///                        a writable location, the function creates a file and the last-error
    ///                        code is set to zero.
    ///    * [`OPEN_EXISTING`] - Opens a file or device, only if it exists. If the specified file
    ///                          or device does not exist, the function fails and the last-error
    ///                          code is set to [`ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`] (2).
    ///    * [`TRUNCATE_EXISTING`] - Opens a file and truncates it so that its size is zero bytes,
    ///                              only if it exists. If the specified file does not exist, the
    ///                              function fails and the last-error code is set to
    ///                              [`ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`] (2). The calling process must open
    ///                              the file with the [`GENERIC_WRITE`] bit set as part of the
    ///                              `desired_access` parameter.
    ///  * `flags_and_attributes` - The file or device attributes and flags,
    ///                             [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL`] being the most common default value
    ///                             for files. This parameter can include any combination of the
    ///                             available file attributes (`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_*`). All other file
    ///                             attributes override [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL`]. This parameter
    ///                             can also contain combinations of flags (`FILE_FLAG_`) for
    ///                             control of file or device caching behavior, access modes, and
    ///                             other special-purpose flags. These combine with any
    ///                             `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_` values. This parameter can also contain
    ///                             Security Quality of Service (SQOS) information by specifying
    ///                             the [`SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT`] flag. Additional SQOS-related
    ///                             flags information is presented in the table following the
    ///                             attributes and flags tables. Some of the following file
    ///                             attributes and flags may only apply to files and not
    ///                             necessarily all other types of devices that [`CreateFile`] can
    ///                             open. The `flags_and_attributes` parameter can also specify
    ///                             SQOS information. When the calling application specifies the
    ///                             [`SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT`] flag as part of
    ///                             `flags_and_attributes`, it can also contain one or more of the
    ///                             following values.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE`] - The file should be archived. Applications use this
    ///                                   attribute to mark files for backup or removal.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTED`] - The file or directory is encrypted. For a file, this
    ///                                     means that all data in the file is encrypted. For a
    ///                                     directory, this means that encryption is the default
    ///                                     for newly created files and subdirectories. This flag
    ///                                     has no effect if [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM`] is also
    ///                                     specified. This flag is not supported on Home, Home
    ///                                     Premium, Starter, or ARM editions of Windows.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN`] - The file is hidden. Do not include it in an ordinary
    ///                                  directory listing.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL`] - The file does not have other attributes set. This
    ///                                  attribute is valid only if used alone.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE`] - The data of a file is not immediately available. This
    ///                                   attribute indicates that file data is physically moved to
    ///                                   offline storage. This attribute is used by Remote
    ///                                   Storage, the hierarchical storage management software.
    ///                                   Applications should not arbitrarily change this
    ///                                   attribute.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY`] - The file is read only. Applications can read the file,
    ///                                    but cannot write to or delete it.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM`] - The file is part of or used exclusively by an operating
    ///                                  system.
    ///    * [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY`] - The file is being used for temporary storage.
    ///    * [`FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS`] - The file is being opened or created for a backup or
    ///                                       restore operation. The system ensures that the
    ///                                       calling process overrides file security checks when
    ///                                       the process has [`SE_BACKUP_NAME`] and
    ///                                       [`SE_RESTORE_NAME`] privileges. You must set this
    ///                                       flag to obtain a handle to a directory. A directory
    ///                                       handle can be passed to some functions instead of a
    ///                                       file handle.
    ///    * [`FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE`] - The file is to be deleted immediately after all of its
    ///                                      handles are closed, which includes the specified
    ///                                      handle and any other open or duplicated handles. If
    ///                                      there are existing open handles to a file, the call
    ///                                      fails unless they were all opened with the
    ///                                      [`FILE_SHARE_DELETE`] share mode. Subsequent open
    ///                                      requests for the file fail, unless the
    ///                                      [`FILE_SHARE_DELETE`] share mode is specified.
    ///    * [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] - The file or device is being opened with no system caching
    ///                                   for data reads and writes. This flag does not affect hard
    ///                                   disk caching or memory mapped files. There are strict

    ///                                   flag.
    ///    * [`FILE_FLAG_OPEN_NO_RECALL`] - The file data is requested, but it should continue to
    ///                                     be located in remote storage. It should not be
    ///                                     transported back to local storage. This flag is for use
    ///                                     by remote storage systems.

    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// [`CreateFile`] was originally developed specifically for file interaction but has since
    /// been expanded and enhanced to include most other types of I/O devices and mechanisms
    /// available to Windows developers. This section attempts to cover the varied issues
    /// developers may experience when using [`CreateFile`] in different contexts and with
    /// different I/O types. The text attempts to use the word file only when referring
    /// specifically to data stored in an actual file on a file system. However, some uses of file
    /// may be referring more generally to an I/O object that supports file-like mechanisms. This
    /// liberal use of the term file is particularly prevalent in constant names and parameter
    /// names because of the previously mentioned historical reasons.
    ///
    /// When an application is finished using the object handle returned by [`CreateFile`], use the
    /// [`CloseHandle`] function to close the handle. This not only frees up system resources, but
    /// can have wider influence on things like sharing the file or device and committing data to
    /// disk. Specifics are noted within this topic as appropriate.
    ///
    /// Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: A sharing violation occurs if an attempt is made to
    /// open a file or directory for deletion on a remote computer when the value of the
    /// `desired_access` parameter is the [`DELETE`] access flag (`0x00010000`) OR'ed with any
    /// other access flag, and the remote file or directory has not been opened with
    /// [`FILE_SHARE_DELETE`]. To avoid the sharing violation in this scenario, open the remote
    /// file or directory with the [`DELETE`] access right only, or call [`DeleteFile`] without
    /// first opening the file or directory for deletion.
    ///
    /// Some file systems, such as the NTFS file system, support compression or encryption for
    /// individual files and directories. On volumes that have a mounted file system with this
    /// support, a new file inherits the compression and encryption attributes of its directory.
    ///
    /// You cannot use CreateFile to control compression, decompression, or decryption on a file or
    /// directory.
    ///
    /// Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: For backward compatibility purposes, [`CreateFile`]
    /// does not apply inheritance rules when you specify a security descriptor in
    /// `security_attributes`. To support inheritance, functions that later query the security
    /// descriptor of this file may heuristically determine and report that inheritance is in
    /// effect.
    ///
    /// As stated previously, if the `security_attributes` parameter is [`null_mut`], the handle
    /// returned by [`CreateFile`] cannot be inherited by any child processes your application may
    /// create. The following information regarding this parameter also applies:
    ///  - If the `inherit_handle` member variable is not [`FALSE`], which is any nonzero value,
    ///    then the handle can be inherited. Therefore it is critical this structure member be
    ///    properly initialized to [`FALSE`] if you do not intend the handle to be inheritable.
    ///  - The access control lists (ACL) in the default security descriptor for a file or
    ///    directory are inherited from its parent directory.
    ///  - The target file system must support security on files and directories for the
    ///    `security_descriptor` member to have an effect on them, which can be determined by using
    ///    [`GetVolumeInformation`].
    ///
    /// Note that [`CreateFile`] with supersede disposition will fail if performed on a file where
    /// there is already an open alternate data stream.
    ///
    /// ## Symbolic Link Behavior
    /// If the call to this function creates a file, there is no change in behavior. Also, consider
    /// the following information regarding [`FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`]:
    ///  - If [`FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`] is specified:
    ///    - If an existing file is opened and it is a symbolic link, the handle returned is a
    ///      handle to the symbolic link.
    ///    - If [`TRUNCATE_EXISTING`] or [`FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE`] are specified, the file
    ///      affected is a symbolic link.
    ///  - If [`FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`] is not specified:
    ///    - If an existing file is opened and it is a symbolic link, the handle returned is a
    ///      handle to the target.
    ///    - If [`CREATE_ALWAYS`], [`TRUNCATE_EXISTING`], or [`FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE`] are
    ///      specified, the file affected is the target.
    ///
    /// ## Caching Behavior
    /// Several of the possible values for the `flags_and_attributes` parameter are used by
    /// [`CreateFile`] to control or affect how the data associated with the handle is cached by
    /// the system. They are:
    ///  - [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`]
    ///  - [`FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS`]
    ///  - [`FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN`]
    ///  - [`FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH`]
    ///  - [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY`]
    ///
    /// If none of these flags is specified, the system uses a default general-purpose caching
    /// scheme. Otherwise, the system caching behaves as specified for each flag.
    ///
    /// Some of these flags should not be combined. For instance, combining
    /// [`FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS`] with [`FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN`] is self-defeating.
    ///
    /// Specifying the [`FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN`] flag can increase performance for applications
    /// that read large files using sequential access. Performance gains can be even more
    /// noticeable for applications that read large files mostly sequentially, but occasionally
    /// skip forward over small ranges of bytes. If an application moves the file pointer for
    /// random access, optimum caching performance most likely will not occur. However, correct
    /// operation is still guaranteed.
    ///
    /// The flags [`FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH`] and [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] are independent and
    /// may be combined.
    ///
    /// If [`FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH`] is used but [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] is not also
    /// specified, so that system caching is in effect, then the data is written to the system
    /// cache but is flushed to disk without delay.
    ///
    /// If [`FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH`] and [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] are both specified, so that
    /// system caching is not in effect, then the data is immediately flushed to disk without going
    /// through the Windows system cache. The operating system also requests a write-through of the
    /// hard disk's local hardware cache to persistent media.
    ///
    /// Proper use of the [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] flag requires special application
    /// considerations.
    ///
    /// A write-through request via [`FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH`] also causes NTFS to flush any
    /// metadata changes, such as a time stamp update or a rename operation, that result from
    /// processing the request. For this reason, the [`FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH`] flag is often used
    /// with the [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] flag as a replacement for calling the
    /// [`FlushFileBuffers`] function after each write, which can cause unnecessary performance
    /// penalties. Using these flags together avoids those penalties.
    ///
    /// When [`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`] is combined with [`FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`], the flags give
    /// maximum asynchronous performance, because the I/O does not rely on the synchronous
    /// operations of the memory manager. However, some I/O operations take more time, because data
    /// is not being held in the cache. Also, the file metadata may still be cached (for example,
    /// when creating an empty file). To ensure that the metadata is flushed to disk, use the
    /// [`FlushFileBuffers`] function.
    ///
    /// Specifying the [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY`] attribute causes file systems to avoid writing
    /// data back to mass storage if sufficient cache memory is available, because an application
    /// deletes a temporary file after a handle is closed. In that case, the system can entirely
    /// avoid writing the data. Although it does not directly control data caching in the same way
    /// as the previously mentioned flags, the [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY`] attribute does tell the
    /// system to hold as much as possible in the system cache without writing and therefore may be
    /// of concern for certain applications.
    ///
    /// ## Files
    /// If you rename or delete a file and then restore it shortly afterward, the system searches
    /// the cache for file information to restore. Cached information includes its short/long name
    /// pair and creation time.
    ///
    /// If you call [`CreateFile`] on a file that is pending deletion as a result of a previous
    /// call to [`DeleteFile`], the function fails. The operating system delays file deletion until
    /// all handles to the file are closed. [`GetLastError`] returns [`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`].
    ///
    /// The `desired_access` parameter can be zero, allowing the application to query file
    /// attributes without accessing the file if the application is running with adequate security
    /// settings. This is useful to test for the existence of a file without opening it for read
    /// and/or write access, or to obtain other statistics about the file or directory.
    ///
    /// If [`CREATE_ALWAYS`] and [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL`] are specified, [`CreateFile`] fails and
    /// sets the last error to [`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`] if the file exists and has the
    /// [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN`] or [`FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM`] attribute. To avoid the error,
    /// specify the same attributes as the existing file.
    ///
    /// When an application creates a file across a network, it is better to use
    /// `GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE` for `desired_access` than to use [`GENERIC_WRITE`] alone.
    /// The resulting code is faster, because the redirector can use the cache manager and send
    /// fewer SMBs with more data. This combination also avoids an issue where writing to a file
    /// across a network can occasionally return [`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`].
    ///
    /// ## Synchronous and Asynchronous I/O Handles
    /// [`CreateFile`] provides for creating a file or device handle that is either synchronous or
    /// asynchronous. A synchronous handle behaves such that I/O function calls using that handle
    /// are blocked until they complete, while an asynchronous file handle makes it possible for
    /// the system to return immediately from I/O function calls, whether they completed the I/O
    /// operation or not. As stated previously, this synchronous versus asynchronous behavior is
    /// determined by specifying [`FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`] within the `flags_and_attributes`
    /// parameter. There are several complexities and potential pitfalls when using asynchronous
    /// I/O.
    ///
    /// ## File Streams
    /// On NTFS file systems, you can use [`CreateFile`] to create separate streams within a file.
    ///
    /// ## Directories
    /// An application cannot create a directory by using [`CreateFile`], therefore only the
    /// [`OPEN_EXISTING`] value is valid for `creation_disposition` for this use case. To create a
    /// directory, the application must call [`CreateDirectory`] or [`CreateDirectoryEx`].
    ///
    /// To open a directory using [`CreateFile`], specify the [`FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS`] flag
    /// as part of `flags_and_attributes`. Appropriate security checks still apply when this flag
    /// is used without [`SE_BACKUP_NAME`] and [`SE_RESTORE_NAME`] privileges.
    ///
    /// When using [`CreateFile`] to open a directory during defragmentation of a FAT or FAT32 file
    /// system volume, do not specify the [`MAXIMUM_ALLOWED`] access right. Access to the directory
    /// is denied if this is done. Specify the [`GENERIC_READ`] access right instead.
    ///
    /// ## Physical Disks and Volumes
    /// Direct access to the disk or to a volume is restricted.
    ///
    /// Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: Direct access to the disk or to a volume is not
    /// restricted in this manner.
    ///
    /// You can use the [`CreateFile`] function to open a physical disk drive or a volume, which
    /// returns a direct access storage device (DASD) handle that can be used with the
    /// [`DeviceIoControl`] function. This enables you to access the disk or volume directly, for
    /// sexample such disk metadata as the partition table. However, this type of access also
    /// exposes the disk drive or volume to potential data loss, because an incorrect write to a
    /// disk using this mechanism could make its contents inaccessible to the operating system. To
    /// ensure data integrity, be sure to become familiar with [`DeviceIoControl`] and how other
    /// APIs behave differently with a direct access handle as opposed to a file system handle.
    ///
    /// The following requirements must be met for such a call to succeed:
    ///  - The caller must have administrative privileges.
    ///  - The `creation_disposition` parameter must have the [`OPEN_EXISTING`] flag.
    ///  - When opening a volume or floppy disk, the `share_mode` parameter must have the
    ///    [`FILE_SHARE_WRITE`] flag.
    ///
    /// When opening a physical drive "x:", the `file_name` string should be the following form:
    /// "\\.\PhysicalDriveX". Hard disk numbers start at zero.
    ///
    /// To obtain the physical drive identifier for a volume, open a handle to the volume and call
    /// the [`DeviceIoControl`] function with [`IOCTL_VOLUME_GET_VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS`]. This
    /// control code returns the disk number and offset for each of the volume's one or more
    /// extents; a volume can span multiple physical disks.
    ///
    /// When opening a volume or removable media drive (for example, a floppy disk drive or flash
    /// memory thumb drive), the `file_name` string should be the following form: "\\.\X:". Do not
    /// use a trailing backslash (\), which indicates the root directory of a drive.
    ///
    /// You can also open a volume by referring to its volume name.
    ///
    /// A volume contains one or more mounted file systems. Volume handles can be opened as
    /// noncached at the discretion of the particular file system, even when the noncached option
    /// is not specified in [`CreateFile`]. You should assume that all Microsoft file systems open
    /// volume handles as noncached. The restrictions on noncached I/O for files also apply to
    /// volumes.
    ///
    /// A file system may or may not require buffer alignment even though the data is noncached.
    /// However, if the noncached option is specified when opening a volume, buffer alignment is
    /// enforced regardless of the file system on the volume. It is recommended on all file systems
    /// that you open volume handles as noncached, and follow the noncached I/O restrictions.
    ///
    /// ## Changer Device
    /// The `IOCTL_CHANGER_*` control codes for DeviceIoControl accept a handle to a changer
    /// device. To open a changer device, use a file name of the following form: "\\.\Changerx"
    /// where x is a number that indicates which device to open, starting with zero. To open
    /// changer device zero in an application that is written in C or C++, use the following file
    /// name: "\\\\.\\Changer0".
    ///
    /// ## Tape Drives
    /// You can open tape drives by using a file name of the following form: "\\.\TAPEx" where x is
    /// a number that indicates which drive to open, starting with tape drive zero. To open tape
    /// drive zero in an application that is written in C or C++, use the following file name:
    /// "\\\\.\\TAPE0".
    ///
    /// ## Communications Resources
    /// The CreateFile function can create a handle to a communications resource, such as the
    /// serial port COM1. For communications resources, the `creation_disposition` parameter must
    /// be [`OPEN_EXISTING`], the `share_mode` parameter must be zero (exclusive access), and the
    /// `template_file` parameter must be [`null_mut`]. Read, write, or read/write access can be
    /// specified, and the handle can be opened for overlapped I/O.
    ///
    /// To specify a COM port number greater than 9, use the following syntax: "\.\COM10". This
    /// syntax works for all port numbers and hardware that allows COM port numbers to be
    /// specified.
    ///
    /// ## Consoles
    /// The [`CreateFile`] function can create a handle to console input (CONIN$). If the process
    /// has an open handle to it as a result of inheritance or duplication, it can also create a
    /// handle to the active screen buffer (CONOUT$). The calling process must be attached to an
    /// inherited console or one allocated by the [`AllocConsole`] function.
    ///
    /// ## Mailslos
    /// If [`CreateFile`] opens the client end of a mailslot, the function returns
    /// [`INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`] if the mailslot client attempts to open a local mailslot before
    /// the mailslot server has created it with the [`CreateMailSlot`] function.
    ///
    /// ## Pipes
    /// If [`CreateFile`] opens the client end of a named pipe, the function uses any instance of
    /// the named pipe that is in the listening state. The opening process can duplicate the handle
    /// as many times as required, but after it is opened, the named pipe instance cannot be opened
    /// by another client. The access that is specified when a pipe is opened must be compatible
    /// with the access that is specified in the `open_mode` parameter of the [`CreateNamedPipe`]
    /// function.
    ///
    /// If the [`CreateNamedPipe`] function was not successfully called on the server prior to this
    /// operation, a pipe will not exist and [`CreateFile`] will fail with
    /// [`ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`].
    ///
    /// If there is at least one active pipe instance but there are no available listener pipes on
    /// the server, which means all pipe instances are currently connected, [`CreateFile`] fails
    /// with [`ERROR_PIPE_BUSY`].
