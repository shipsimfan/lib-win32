    /// The [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] interface accesses and manipulates the duplicated desktop
    /// image.
    ///
    /// # Remarks
    /// A collaboration application can use [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] to access the desktop image.
    /// [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] is supported in Desktop Window Manager (DWM) on non-8bpp DirectX
    /// full-screen modes and non-8bpp OpenGL full-screen modes. 16-bit or 32-bit GDI non-DWM
    /// desktop modes are not supported.
    ///
    /// An application can use [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] on a separate thread to receive the
    /// desktop images and to feed them into their specific image-processing pipeline. The
    /// application uses [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] to perform the following operations:
    ///  1. Acquire the next desktop image.
    ///  2. Retrieve the information that describes the image.
    ///  3. Perform an operation on the image. This operation can be as simple as copying the image
    ///     to a staging buffer so that the application can read the pixel data on the image. The
    ///     application reads the pixel data after the application calls [`IDXGISurface::map`].
    ///     Alternatively, this operation can be more complex. For example, the application can run
    ///     some pixel shaders on the updated regions of the image to encode those regions for
    ///     transmission to a client.
    ///  4. After the application finishes processing each desktop image, it releases the image,
    ///     loops to step 1, and repeats the steps. The application repeats these steps until it is
    ///     finished processing desktop images.
    ///
    /// The following components of the operating system can generate the desktop image:
    ///  - The DWM by composing the desktop image
    ///  - A full-screen DirectX or OpenGL application
    ///  - An application by switching to a separate desktop, for example, the secure desktop that
    ///    is used to display the login screen
    ///
    /// All current [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] interfaces become invalid when the operating system
    /// switches to a different component that produces the desktop image or when a mode change
    /// occurs. In these situations, the application must destroy its current
    /// [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] interface and create a new [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] interface.
    ///
    /// Examples of situations in which [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] becomes invalid are:
    ///  - Desktop switch
    ///  - Mode change
    ///  - Switch from DWM on, DWM off, or other full-screen application
    ///
    /// In these situations, the application must release the [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] interface
    /// and must create a new [`IDXGIOutputDuplication`] interface for the new content. If the
    /// application does not have the appropriate privilege to the new desktop image, its call to
    /// the [`IDXGIOutput1::duplicate_output`] method fails.
    ///
    /// While the application processes each desktop image, the operating system accumulates all
    /// the desktop image updates into a single update.
    ///
    /// The desktop image is always in the [`DXGI_FORMAT::B8G8R8A8UNorm`] format.
